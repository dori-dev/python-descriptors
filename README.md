# Python Descriptors

Python descriptors to solving the problems of property(getter)

#

## What is the Problem?

Using **property(getter)**, setter, deleter for all variables,
It creates similar(it repeats itself) code and the code is not clean!
<br>
The problem source code: [problem.py](problem.py)

#

## What is the Solution?

By using **descriptors** and creating classes for similar variable types,
It creates clean code and doesn't repeat itself
<br>
The solution source code: [solution.py](solution.py)
